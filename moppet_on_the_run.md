# Moppet *on the Run*

"Come and see Moppet," said Laura to her friend Sally.
"I'm just going to feed here."

The girl walked over to see the little guinea pig.

"Where is she?" asked Sally, as they both looked inside the cage.

"Oh, no!" cried Laura. "She's **gone**!"

Sally looked around.   
"We'll have to find her quickly," she said.  
"Dogs get guinea pigs sometimes."

Robert and Harry ran over to the cage.

"How did Moppet get out?" asked Robert.

"Look!" said Harry.  
"There's a little hollow down there   
in the grass. She must have pushed   
her way out under the cage."

"I didn't think guinea pigs  
could do that!" said Robert.

The children hunted aound 
the yard for Moppet.

Suddently, Moppet darted out from behind a tree.

"There she is!"shouted Laura."She's going into those pink flowers".

Harry ran over to the pink flowers and reached in to get Moppet.

But the little guinea pig was too quick for him. She slipped through his hands and scurried across the grass.

Then she ran into some leaves and hid there.

The children looked down at the leaves.

Sally said, 
"Guinea pigs are hard to catch. One of ours esaped one day."

"What happened to it?" asked Harry.

"That doesn't matter now," said Robert, looking on Laura's face. "come on! We've got to catch Moppet."

"But how can we do it?" asked Sally.

Then Laura said, "Wait here and keep watching the leaves. I've got an idea!"

Laura ran over to the table and pulled the cloth off it. She raced back to the leaves and spread where Moppet was hiding.
"Hold on to a corner, everyone" she said,"and keep the sides down."

The children could see where Moppet was.They watched the little bump she made as she ran around under the tablecloth.

Then, very solwly, Laura reached out and caught Moppet through the tablecloth . "I've **got** her!"she said.
"But she's very scared .I can feel her shaking." Moppet wriggled and struggled, but Laura held on. "Quick!"
she said to the others. "Turn the tablecloth over while I keep holding her."
