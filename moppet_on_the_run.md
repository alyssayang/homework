# Moppet *on the Run*

"Come and see Moppet," said Laura to her friend Sally.
"I'm just going to feed here."

The girl walked over to see the little guinea pig.

"Where is she?" asked Sally, as they both looked inside the cage.

"Oh, no!" cried Laura. "She's **gone**!"

Sally looked around.   
"We'll have to find here quickly," she said.  
"Dogs get guinea pigs sometimes."

Robert and Harry ran over to the cage.

"How did Moppet get out?" asked Robert.

"Look!" said Harry.  
"There's a little hollow down there   
in the grass. She must have pushed   
her way out under the cage."

"I didn't think guinea pigs  
could do that!" said Robert.

The children hunted aound 
the yard for Moppet.
