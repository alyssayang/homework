# Princess Lulu - Goes to Camp

Lulu was a princess. She lived in a
big castle near a big lake with a big
fountain in the minddle.
people came from all over to see 
the castle. They came to see Lulu's 
father, the king, and Lulu's mother,
the queeen. Sometimes they even
came to see Lulu.
"No autographs, please," Lulu
would say with a sniff.
Then she would wave a little wave,
and nod a little nod, and turn to
her right. That was her best side.
Everyone said so.
Life in the castle was fun. Lulu
had her own princess-sized bedroom.
It had a princess-sized water bed,
a princess-sized TY, and a pale-pink
princess telphone. "No princess 
should be without one," she would
say it to her self.
It's too cold!" Lulu would screech
into the phone. Then a maid would 
race up with a fuzzy, pink blanket.
"Snack!"she would 
scream at the top of
her lungs. Then a chef
would rush in with 
a plate of cookies.
