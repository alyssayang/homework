# Princess Lulu - Goes to Camp

Lulu was a princess. She lived in a
big castle near a big lake with a big
fountain in the minddle.

People came from all over to see 
the castle. They came to see Lulu's 
father, the king, and Lulu's mother,
the queeen. Sometimes they even
came to see Lulu.

"No autographs, please," Lulu
would say with a sniff.
Then she would wave a little wave,
and nod a little nod, and turn to
her right. That was her best side.
Everyone said so.
Life in the castle was fun. Lulu
had her own princess-sized bedroom.
It had a princess-sized water bed,
a princess-sized TY, and a pale-pink
princess telphone. "No princess 
should be without one," she would
say it to her self.
It's too cold!" Lulu would screech
into the phone. Then a maid would 
race up with a fuzzy, pink blanket.
"Snack!"she would 
scream at the top of
her lungs. Then a chef
would rush in with 
a plate of cookies.
Anything Lulu wanted, Lulu had.
But there was one thing Lulu did
not have is a friend.
"Who neeeds one!"she would
say to a spot on her wall.
But the king and the queeen were worried.
They spoke to the royal wise man.
"She's smart,"said the king.
"She's pretty,"said the queen.
The wise man put one arm around
the king and the queen.
"She's a royal pain!" he said.
"Oh my!"said the queen.
"Oh dear!"said the king. But they
knew he was right.
"She must learn to get along with 
others," said the wise man. "Perhaps
a summer camp would help. I
suggest Camp Ruff'n'Tuff". He
showed them a booklet.
All the campers have 
to make their own beds.
All the campers have 
to learn to
make a fire. "Ew!"said the queen.
"Ugh!"said the king. But they knew
he was right.
The next day, the princess got on a
big yellow bus. It smelled like Twizzle
sticks and oranges and a tuna fish.
"My stars!" said the gril sitting 
next to her. "Want some?"
Lulu stared strainght ahed.
"I guess not."said the gril. Then
she stuck her head out the window
and yelled, "Camp Ruff'n' Tuff, here
we come!"
Camp Ruff'n'Tuff had five bunks,
a mess hall, and a tiny lake. "No
yacht?" asked Lulu. Then she watied
for someone to carry her bags.
"Do you need a hand?"said the 
gril with the tuna sandwich. "We are
in the same bunk."
Lulu rolled her eyes. But she 
handed the bags over her bags.
"You'er welcome," said the gril.
Bunk C had four bunk beds, two
lightbulbs, and one counselor-
Janine.
"Listen up," said Janine. "There will 
be no gum cheming, no mess beds,
and no taking after lighs-out."
The gril with the tuna sandwich 
made a face. "She forgot no fun,"
she wispered.
"No phone?! screehed Lulu.
Then she looked on the shelves
and under the beds. "No TV, either!"
She gulped.
The next morning Lulu screamed
for her breafast, but no one came.
So she put on her best dress and
her best shoes and her best sparkly
crown. Then she walked to the 
mess hall. On the way, three
things happened.
Frist she got stung by a bee.
Then she fell in the mud.
Then her crown landed in the lake.
Lulu fixed her crown. "I'm not a 
happy camper,"she said.
Tuna giggled. "You are funny," she 
said. Then she giggle some more.
Lulu smiled. A teeny, tiny smiled. She
had never made anyone giggled before.
"Bunk C, to the lake!" said
a voice over the loudspeak.
"That's us," said Tuna.
They ran to their bunk and put on 
their swimsuits.
Lulu pulled on her royal
bathing cap.
"Nice cap," said Tuna.
Lulu patted her head.
"You'er welcome," said Tuna.
At the lake, kids were laughing
and splashing . Tuna jumped off the 
dock. "Come on in!" she yelled.
lulu stuck one toe in the water.
"It"s to cold," she said. 
Lulu watched everyone laughing
and splashing. It looked like fun.
She closed her eyes and jumped.
"HELP!"screamed Lulu when she 
hit the water.
Tuna swam over. "What's wrong?"
she asked.
Lulu waved her arms in the air.
"I forgot," she choked. "I can't swim."
Tuna giggled. "Try standing,"
she said.
"Oh," said Lulu. She stopped
waving her arms.
"HAW! HAW! HAW!" laughed
Tuna. "You are so funny!"
Lulu giggled a teeny, tiny giggled.
"I am funny," she said to herself.
on Friday, Bunk C went on 
an overnight. They marched
for five miles.
"Move it! Move it!" barked Janine.
They pitched tents.
They chopped wood for a campfire.
For dinner they cooked hot
dogs over the fire. All of a sudded,
everyone started screaming.
They were pointing at Tuna.
"Skunk! Right behind you!" yelled
a gril with a blond poytail. 
"Run for your life!"screamed
someone else.
"Major stink bomb!" shouted a gril
with purpule sneakers.
"Every camper for herself!" yelled
Janine. She dived behind a tree.
Soon eveyone was hiding. Except
for Tuna. She was too stared to
move. "Help!" she squeaked.
Lulu stood up. She marched over 
to the sunk.
"Skunk, begon!" she ordered
in her loudest princess voice. She
stamped her foot on the ground.
She shook her royal crown in the air.
"Begone, I say!"
The skunk took one look at Lulu
and raced off into the woods.
Everyone clapped and cheered.
Tuna giggled. "You are a real
friend," she said to Lulu. "Thanks
for helping me out.
Lulu smiled a teeny, tiny smile.
"You're welcome," Lulu said.
After that, the princess and Tuna
did everything togerter.
They told stories after lights-go out.
They made friendship bracelets in 
arts and crafts.
Lulu even learned how to swim
(well, sort of.)
Then it was time to go home. On the 
bus, Tuna gave Lulu a present.
It was a pencil with her address on it.
"Now we can be pencil pals," she said.
The next day, Lulu sat on her 
princess-sized bed. She thought
about Camp Ruff'n'Tuff. Then she wrote a letter-a letter to her
new friend. "No princess should be 
without one," she said to herself.
And she smiled a great, big,
princess-sized smile.
